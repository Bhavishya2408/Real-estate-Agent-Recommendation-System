# Buyer Folio: Real Estate Agent Recommendation System

## Overview

The recommendation system enhances transparency, fairness, and decision-making in the real estate market by integrating advanced analytics, natural language processing, and data visualization techniques.

---

## Key Features

1. **Recommendation System**:
   - Identifies the top real estate agents based on user inputs (e.g., location).
   - Computes a Fit Score by equally weighting agent experience and rating.
   - Filters and ranks agents serving the desired location.

2. **Visualization**:
   - Interactive maps displaying top agents using Folium and MarkerCluster.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Conducts sentiment analysis on agent reviews using natural language processing (NLP).

4. **Data Governance**:
   - Addresses data ownership, equitable access, and ethical issues.
